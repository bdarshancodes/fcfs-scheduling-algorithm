# FCFS Scheduling Algorithm (C Program)

This project implements the **First Come First Serve (FCFS)** CPU scheduling algorithm in C.  
It calculates **Completion Time (CT)**, **Turnaround Time (TAT)**, **Waiting Time (WT)**, and their averages for multiple processes.

---

## Features
- Takes number of processes as input.
- Takes **Arrival Time (AT)** and **Burst Time (BT)** for each process.
- Calculates:
  - Completion Time (CT)
  - Turnaround Time (TAT)
  - Waiting Time (WT)
- Displays results in a tabular format.
- Calculates **Average TAT** and **Average WT**.
